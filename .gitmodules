# ----- Vendored dependencies

# Vendored code is in the ty-vendors repo, but in different branches
# — and each branch is checked out as a separate submodule, where it's needed,
# e.g. OpenResty at images/web/openresty, so accessible to the
# images/web/Dockerfile.
# But why not different submodules, instead of branches? Because creating
# different submodules is boring, right. Creating a new branch is quicker.
#
# To fetch only the current branch from the remote repo, do this:
#
#   git fetch origin `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
#
#   # Or with Git >= v2.22: (not tested)
#   git fetch origin `git branch --show-current`
#
# To add a submodule but only a branch, do e.g.:
#
#   git submodule add -b ty-openresty \
#       https://github.com/debiki/ty-vendors.git \
#       images/web/openresty
#
# Maybe different platforms (Debian 9 or 10 or Ubuntu 20.04 or maybe
# MS and Cygwin somehow?) will sometimes download or generate slightly
# different files?  So maybe this approach with vendored deps in submodules,
# will need some tweaking somehow. — Code get compiled and built
# in containers, but *not* Webdriverio test suite; it runs directly
# on the host OS (so any node-gyp built stuff then depends on the host OS).
