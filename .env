# ----- The internal net  [TYINTNET]

# Give containers static ips, because things in the OS or applications seem to
# remember the containers ip addresses (even if Docker's DNS server return
# up-to-date ips) and requests then can fail to reach their destination,
# if a container gets restarted with a new dynamic ip.
# Use 172.27 but not 172.26 — because 26 is used in prod, and using the same
# could cause ip addr space collision problems when switching between prod and
# dev environments on localost.
#
# So let's use: 172.27.0.0-127:  172.27.0.bits-0*******

# 1..19 is for Docker's gateway, and for Docker's DHCP server to use if needed.
# Docker's DHCP server seems to pick as low ip addresses as possible — so don't
# use 172.27.0. 2, 3, 4, 5 etc ourselves for static ips (because the containers
# would then fail to start, if Docker has used the ip for sth else, like
# a temporary test container we've started, already). Start at 21 instead.
