# Enable just-in-time compilation of regular expressions in the Nginx config
# files, at startup. "Can speed up processing of regular expressions significantly",
# http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#pcre_jit.
# Apparently by default Nginx otherwise evaluates regexs dynamically after startup:
# https://www.getpagespeed.com/server-setup/nginx-locations-performance-impact-and-optimizations
#
# This needs package pcre-devel and build flag --with-pcre-jit.
# (can test: pcretest -C   that needs:  apk add pcre   not just  pcre-dev  ?)
# (Seems PCRE isn't used at all in Nginx official images:
# https://github.com/nginxinc/docker-nginx/issues/147#issuecomment-279330224
# > As we're not building PCRE in the official images [pcre_jit on will not help].
# But then how does Nginx by default handle location regexs?
# Seems it just doesn't work, by default:
# https://www.computers.wtf/posts/nginx-with-pcre/
# > [ if you use a location regex or rewrite ] you’ll get a 404 Not Found response
# > from Nginx. That’s because PCRE is required for regular expressions’ support
# > in the location directive and for ngx_http_rewrite_module to kick in,
# > but Nginx doesn’t come integrated with it out of the box.  )
