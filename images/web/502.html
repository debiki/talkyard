502 Bad Gateway [TyE502BGW]

Nginx cannot connect to Play Framework. Is Play not running, or is there some network error?

If you use Docker-Compose, please check if the app container (which runs Play Framework)
is running:  'docker-compose ps'

If it's not running:
- Start it:  'docker-compose start app'. Then wait a few seconds and reload this page.
- Or login in a Bash shell:  'docker-compose run --rm --service-ports app bash'

If it is running:
- Check the logs:  'docker-compose logs'
- Only Play's logs: 'docker-compose logs app'
- Or jump into the container:  'docker-compose exec app bash'
