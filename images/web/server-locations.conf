# ----- HTTPS
#
# HTTPS public and private keys are located in /etc/letsencrypt/, and included
# not-from-this-file but from the sites-available/*.conf files.

#ssl_certificate...  – defined in sites-available/*.conf instead
# ssl_...  – defined in nginx.conf

# [ty_v1] Remove .well-known from here. Include it instead in the
# default servers file, which can be edited — in case someone doesn't want
# to use LetsEncrypt, or needs to add more .well-known contents.
#
# Magic files for generating HTTPS certificates with Let's Encrypt.
location /.well-known {

  # oops, to verify Azure AD domain, needs to host a file here:
  # https://{YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE}.com/.well-known/
  #      microsoft-identity-association.json

# ----- Bad requests

# Bots on the Internet send requests with weird URL paths, making  [block_bad_reqs]
# Play Framework log annoying warnings. Block such requests.
#
# Examples:
#  """Illegal request-target: Invalid input '\"',
#     expected pchar, '/', '?' or 'EOI' (line 1, column 10):
#     /spacespp\"pga'ofz/13/index.html\n         ^"""
#
# - Play Framework also rejects '^<>{}[]' in the URL path, but allows
#   them in the query string. Let's reject them everywhere for simplicity.
# - '()' is supposedly ok to use in urls — and actually Facebook
#   uses '()' in FB's Graph API:
#   https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api
#   https://graph.facebook.com/{user-id}?fields=feed.limit(3)
# - PHP uses [] for arrays in the query string; there're indeed auto hack
#   attempt requests with '[]' and PHP software name in the URL path.
#
# Old RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738#page-3
#   > The characters "<" and ">" are unsafe because they are used as the
#   > delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark (""") is used to
#   > delimit URLs in some systems.  The character "#" is unsafe and should
#   > always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
#   > systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might
#   > follow it.  The character "%" is unsafe because it is used for
#   > encodings of other characters.  Other characters are unsafe because
#   > gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
#   > such characters. These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", "~",
#   > "[", "]", and "`".
#   > All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL
#   >
#   > [...] the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
#   > reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
#   > unencoded
#
# Nevertheless don't allow "'" — would just confuse CommonMark parsers if
# someone pastes such an url? But '~' is fine I think, at least "~" was in
# the URL paths at University.

# Also reject  \x00-\x20  and \x7f-\xff — trying out this at Ty.io:
#   tion ~ '[\x00-\x20`\'"^\\\\<>\{\}\[\]\|\x7f-\xff]' {
#
# \x00-\x1f are control chars, \x20 is space.  \x7f is a control char,
# \x80-\xff are language specific letters.
#
# To type a real tab in Bash:  Ctrl+V Tab   — can incl in a cURL url to test
# sending a control char (i.e. tab, \x09 aka ^I.)  Or just incl a ' ' space.
# To test the upper range, \x7f-\xff,  incl sth like  åäö  or  úéý  in the url.
#
# Or this, seems to send %00 null, and %20 space and %33 the digit '3' (ASCII 51):
# curl -v -v 'https://www.talkyard.io/%00'  — 400 Bad request
# curl -v -v 'https://www.talkyard.io/%20'  — 400 Bad char in URL
# curl -v -v 'https://www.talkyard.io/%33'  — 404 Not Found
#
location ~ '[`\'"^\\\ \n\t<>\{\}\[\]\|]' {
  return 400 'Bad char in URL [TyENGXURLCH]\n';
}

# Instead of this:
# if ($http_host ~ '[`\'"\\\ \n\t<>(){}\[\],;+*^$!?&=#]') {
#   ...
# there's a  server {} block with a server_name regex, which rejects
# requests with weird hostnames — see nginx.conf.


# Later: Block requests with no Host header? Or is it good to be able
# to connect just via IP, for troubleshooting?
