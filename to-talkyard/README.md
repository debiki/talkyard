Usage:

    node to-talkyard/dist/to-talkyard/src/to-talkyard.js --help

If importing from MySQL / PgSQL etc, maybe: https://github.com/tgriesser/knex


Initiallly cloned from: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter,
and everything now deleted except for things like tslint and some package.json settings.


If later on there'll be many stand-alone packages like this, then consider
using  https://lernajs.io/  ?  Maybe the slim-bundle, more-bundle etc could
be their own Lerna packages, hmm.


SECURITY [to_ty_risky] Any way to run to-talkyard in a sandbox?
Nodejs code that parses user defined data = a tiny bit risky.
