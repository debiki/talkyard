In this file: Bookmarks todos.  [bookmarks_wip]

Also see: ../../docs/design-docs/bookmarks.dd.adoc

Disabled in prod,
      until there are auto tests,  see ^bookmarks in ../../docs/tests-map.txt,
      and the below todos fixed.

When enabling: Update the renderer version (from 0.00.79 to 0.00.80), and remove the
!ifLoggedIn test so the  Go to latest  buton is shown also if logged out, see: [renderer_version].


TODO:
  - Maybe create new fns:  ReactActions.createBookmark() and editBookmark(),
    instead of reusing  ReactActions.saveReply()  etc.
    And server enpoints too — the one's for replying & editing do too many off-topic things?

  - Review editPostIfAuth & create-post & changePostStatusImpl() again,
    so doesn't do weird things w bookmarks:
              (Better to instead created a dedicated edit-bookmark? see just above)
      No upload refs
      No links
      Not approved
      No review
      No spam check tasks
      No stats updated (except for posts seen maybe) [0_stats_for_priv_posts]  [0_ln_from_priv]
      No notfs  [0_bokm_notfs]
  - Done: Websocket, check not bookmark.
  - Bug: Add/remove tag to bookmarked post. Bookmark igon gets un-highlighted, as if bookm gone
          (but it's there after reload).

  - BUG: Bookmarks list not auto updated, when editing or deleting bookmark.
    See  [bookmark_edits_and_updates]  in ../../client/app-slim/sidebar/sidebar.ts.
    (Need to rewrite to a function component, and use useStoreEvent()?)
    Delete & add bookark —> listed twice, until reload (since adding, but not deleting, works)

  - Ugly error diag if trying to bookmark sth twice

  - Write e2e tests



Skip?:
  - Shouldn't ids too, not only nrs, be < 0?
    Or all ids should be random, but that's an a bit big change now?


Later:

[how_load_bookmarks]
Currently we just load all bookmarks (up to 999), works fine, the feature is new, there
aren't many.  Later, load bookmarks ordered by:
    - Current page, visible posts first,
          then by time recent first.
    - Whole forum, recent first.

[bookmark_search_sort]
Index bookmarks. Private, per user — maybe a dediated index?. Search & sort fields,
when listing bookmarks.  And search one's bookmarks only: [is_bokm].

[order_bokms]
Make it possible to drag-and-drop reorder todos (bookmarks, drafts, tasks) in one's sidebar,
and change sort order, e.g. by order, recent first, (oldest first?), or by search query.
Use nodes_t / posts3.order_c?

[bookmark_tasks]
First make it possible to let ordinary comments be tasks. [comment_tasks]
Then, expose a make-task & doing UI for bookmarks too?



Much later:

[bookmark_shapes_colors]
Different shapes and colors would be nice? It's pretty useful in Gmail.

[tagd_bokms]
Make it possible to tag one's bookmarks? Let's say you use Ty for work for days & years,
and end up with 1000 bookmarks — could be nice with some structure?

  Compare tags:
    tag:year:desc>1990  
    tag:priority:desc>=3

  Then, bookmarks with tags?:
    bookmarks:asc<=3             # sorts by  posts3.order_c, ascending, up to 3.0 ?
    bookmarks:due-at:asc<=MM-DD  # finds bookmarks tagged  due-at  and due before MM-DD ?

  What was I thinking? A dot '.' not ':' like elsewhere?:   Aha, a '.' dot is a field, ':' for tags?
    bookmark:to-do.due-at:asc>=now&.open
    bookmark:to-do priority:desc>=3

  has:priority:desc>=3

  priority:desc>=3   // finds tag:priority  and  bookmarks.priority   and  badge:proirity

  task:priority>=3   // finds posts (incl bookmarks) with doing status New/Planned/Doing/Done  ?
    is:open          // and not Closed (e.g. becuase Done)


  Create one's own tag types & bookmark types? E.g. "Reply-to", "Read-later", "To-do", "Reference",
    and filter on, say, "Reply-to" & "To-do", to find out what you should
    probably do next.
