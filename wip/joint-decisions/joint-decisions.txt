[joint_decisions]

Some decisions might need two or more mods or admins to agree? E.g. to promote a user
to Core Member, or to add/remove a moderator.  Or, if an admin needs to check
who an anonymous user is (e.g. because the anon wrote sth dangerous).

If cannot trust all admins, then, optionally (forum wide settings) require many admins
to agree (e.g. two), and notify all other admins, if wants to do any of:

- Impersonating anyone.  [imp_notfs]
- See who an anonymous user or pseudonym is
- Looking at email addresses or IP addresses in email logs, request logs, audit logs
  (e.g. when this anonym got a reply, to what email address did the notification get sent?).
- Changing any related forum setting.
- Adding/removing mods and admins.

Background:  Sometimes, e.g. in a university, all forum admins don't
necessarily have 100.0% good intentions: Sometimes students want to discuss
mental health _and problematic teachers_ — and who knows if one of the admins,
is in fact one of the problematic teachers.

Obviously, if any admin has direct ssh or psql access to the Talkyard server,
they can do whatever — but bigger organizations typically don't let "any random
teacher" have unrestricted access to their IT systems. The IT staff that _do_
have access to the servers, probably don't interact much with the students (the
IT staff is less likely to _also_ work as teachers).  And if a university
uses Ty as a SaaS, then no wone has such access.


How could joint decisions work?

  - A mod or admin creates a page of type Decision (or type Suggestion? or Ask? Maybe a
    decision is the _result_), other mods/admins might leave comments and discuss.
  - The difference between a Decision page and an Idea page, is that the Decision page
    makes something happen automatically: the software takes some action,
    once the decision has been made, e.g. promotes sbd to moderator.
    (Maybe in some cases, a webhook could get sent to some external system.)
    While with Idea pages, it's up to the humans to maybe implement the idea or not,
    and there's no specific point in time when the Talkyard software considers
    the idea decided or not.
  - Then, the others vote, using Do-It and Do-Not votes.  [do_it_votes]
  - Sometimes it can be enough if just one more mod or admin agrees, and no one disagrees;
    in other cases, maybe most mods or admins need to vote, and if there're x times more
    Do-It than Do-Not votes, then it happens (e.g. sbd promoted to Core Member).
  - Sometimes there'd be a time limit, e.g. 1 week.
  - Sometimes there's one person, say, a forum owner, who can always decide things single
    handedly. Han might want to delegate to mods & admins most of the time,
    but don't want any single admin to be able to do whatever, so the others can only do
    important things via joint decisions.
Votes?:
    Enact / +3  (if e.g. the owner can decide things single-handedly)
    Approve / +2 (in Gerrit)
    For (Do-It vote) / + 1
    I've read, and let others decide  0
    Against (Do-Not vote) / -1
    Strongly against / -2 
    Veto / -3  (if e.g. owner won't allow this)
Examples of things that in *some* communities might require joint decisions:
  -  Impersonate
  -  SeeWhoIs  (see who a pseudonym or anonym is)
  -  PromoteToTrusted / PromoteToCore
  -  GrantMod / RevokeMod
  -  GrantAdmin / RevokeAdmin
     # If AgreePercent is say 33%, then 33% of the admins need to have
     # agreed, rounded up. So, if there are, say, 5 admins,
     # then 1.67 rounded up = 2 admins need to agree. That is,
     # if just 1 admin votes Do-It, it's ok to do it (since the one
     # who asked, implicitly voted Do-It.)

  -  ChangeDisagreePercent
