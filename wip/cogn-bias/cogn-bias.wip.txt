Mitigating cognitive biases
===========================

Probably we'll add features that mitigate cognitive biases to Talkyard.

Add a  perms_on_pages3.can_see_orig_c,
just because it makes sense, in some cases, f.ex. a teacher posts to hans class,
and all students can see the teacher's post (the OP, original post), and reply,
but the students can't see each other's replies.
Then, the teacher(s) can talk individually with each student, on the same page
â€” nice for the teacher to not have to manage say 30 different discussion pages
about the same thing.

But that's probably not how to implement hiding-everyone's-replies to mitigate cogn biases.

Instead, that should be some other status toggle?

Because sometimes you'd want both at the same time: a teacher posing to the class,
and the *teacher* doesn't want to see anyone's replies, until ... later, to mitigate
biases (in the teacher).

Then, can't use can_see_orig_c as part of the anti-cogn-bias "workflow".

Instead, new settings needed? On posts3? pages3?  If possible, start w posts3,
more compat w a future where cats, pages, posts all are node?  [its_a_node]
