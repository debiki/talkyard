Private comments [priv_comts], also see  maybe-do-later.txt.


A better way to implement private comments:  [priv_comts_pages]
(Then maybe negative nrs should be "personal" rather than "private" ?)

For each private comment and sub comments, create a new & separate *page*,
and let it be a sub page, of PageType.PrivateComments, of the current page.

Benefits:
 - Won't load private comments by mistake. They're on totally different pages.
 - Can use the same access permission to manage who can see a private thread,
    as for managing members of a private chat or private DMs.
 - Pretty easy & efficient to load all private comments, for those who are
    talking in private sub threads: An index on parent page id & child page type,
    to load all relevant private comment trees (pages), and then filter on
    one's id and groups to know which ones one can see.
 - Can reuse for implementing sub tasks [sub_pages].

That's better than storing private trees as ordinary comments but with negative ids
and inventing a new permission system, like I was thinking when I added
   posts3.private_pats_id_c and private_status_c.
Let's just drop those columns instead.

This could be a nice way to (re)implement flags? A flag is then a separate
page linking to the flagged post, [flags_as_posts]  and any discussion about
the flagged comment can be shown inline in the discussion with the flagged comment,
just like private comment threads. Only the mods could see, and they'll now
have all the context (all ancestor comments) & any discussions about the flagged
comment visible at once.
