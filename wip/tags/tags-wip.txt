Later:

More data types, e.g. dates, date ranges, full text, geo locations,
& ways to filter & search, e.g. all pages/events close to a city (coordinate).
See Scala object TypeValueType.

Distant future:

[bottom_up_tags]
Let people create their own tag types, own names.
These will be scoped by user id, so won't be name conflicts (the db constraints
in the tagtypes_t table support this alraedy, e.g.: tagtypes_u_anypat_urlslug).
Later, moderators can promote these personal tag types to official tags
(if the users want).
