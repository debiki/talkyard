            (page id & slug lost)

    All ReactRouter's NavLink basically don't work in an iframe:
      (Nor does Link, but using TyLink instead, fine.)

    "View categories"
      —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/categories?embHow=Forum&embgUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fe2e-test-www.localhost%3A8080%2Femb-page-one.html&logLevel=trace&embPathParam=%23%2F&embeddingScriptV=2

      Doesn't work, iframe lost

    "Active|Popular|New"

      Doesn't work, iframe lost
  
SECURITY; COULD make [which endpoints are allowed in an embedded forum] configurable.
F.ex. some communities might want direct messages to be allowed only if accessing
the forum directly (not embedded), see:  GroupTalkController.sendMessage().
But that's overdoing it, for now.
