[maybe_need_only_embPathParam]
We need only  embPathParam?  Can skip  embeddingUrl, embgUrl, and embHow?
Anduse embedding page relative links, like:
  #/-123/talkyard-page
  #/latest/bugs
  #/-/users/someone
and they'll resolve relative the embedding page, and will just work, right?
Likewise, these would also work, just that any other query params would disappear,
but typically there would be no other query params:
  ?ty=/-123/talkyard-page
  ?ty=/latest/bugs
  ?ty=/-/users/someone
  ?ty=/-/search%3Fq=some-search-query   ('%3F' = ? but % encoded)

  Old source code comment: (about [maybe_need_only_embPathParam])
    // because that'll get resolved relative the <base> url which is the embedding page url
    // already, same as:  embgUrl.origin + embgUrl.pathname + embgUrl.search
    // right?
    // And just '#' + tyPath is *better*, because will continue working also if
    // the embedding page is moved to another url path, or even to another domain?
    //
    // Then, need only the  talkyard-embedded-url-param as cached-html-lookup?
    // But posts need to be rendered twice:
    //   - With user profile links like:  '/-/users/someone'  if not embedded
    //   - With user profile links like:  '#/-/users/someone' if embedded
    //     What if changing the embedded url param to eg  ?forumPath=...
    //                                    '?forumPath=/-/users/someone'
    //     — then, all @mention links would break until all posts rerendered?
    //     And all UI links too but they're quick to regenerate,
    //     need not render any CommonMark.
    //
    // So, maybe  posts3/posts_t +=
    //   embd_approved_html_sanitized_c   ?   (or  approved_embd_html_sanitized_c)
    //   embd_url_param_c                 ?


Fix links:
   "Solved in post #2, click to viewReplyChange ..."
       —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/emb-page-one.html#post-2
            (page id & slug lost)

    All ReactRouter's NavLink basically don't work in an iframe:
      (Nor does Link, but using TyLink instead, fine.)

    "View categories"
      —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/categories?embHow=Forum&embgUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fe2e-test-www.localhost%3A8080%2Femb-page-one.html&logLevel=trace&embPathParam=%23%2F&embeddingScriptV=2

      Doesn't work, iframe lost

    "Active|Popular|New"
      —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/new?embHow=Forum&embgUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fe2e-test-www.localhost%3A8080%2Femb-page-one.html&logLevel=trace&embPathParam=%23%2F&embeddingScriptV=2

      Doesn't work, iframe lost
  
SECURITY; COULD make [which endpoints are allowed in an embedded forum] configurable.
F.ex. some communities might want direct messages to be allowed only if accessing
the forum directly (not embedded), see:  GroupTalkController.sendMessage().
But that's overdoing it, for now.

[cache_embg_url]
Cache html per embedding url, and then do include embedding url & origin in the cached pages?
See:  page_html_cache_t.param_embg_url_or_empty_c.
Actually, no, don't cache the embedding url. Instead, we need to cache only the embPathParam!,
that is, page_html_cache_t.param_embd_url_param_c.

Thereafter, can solve the  [TyLink_problems]?


REMOVE; DO_AFTER // v0.2025.011  [rm_embeddingUrl_param]


Emb forum iframe:
    UX BUG: Doesn't downsize itself, if emb forum.


If non-existing page, e.g.:  https://www.ex.co/forum#/non-existing-page, then don't open
a login popup in the iframe, just results in:
      Login dialog in emb iframe [TyE5KER2]


Do uploaded images work? Or are they resolved against the embedding page's url? [emb_img_urls]


Frag action #composeDirectMessage not working in emb forum iframe, oh well:
    http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/emb-page-one.html#/-/users/michael/activity/posts#composeDirectMessage
