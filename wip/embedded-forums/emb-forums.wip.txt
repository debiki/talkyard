Fix links:
   "Solved in post #2, click to viewReplyChange ..."
       —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/emb-page-one.html#post-2
            (page id & slug lost)

    All ReactRouter's NavLink basically don't work in an iframe:
      (Nor does Link, but using TyLink instead, fine.)

    "View categories"
      —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/categories?embHow=Forum&embgUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fe2e-test-www.localhost%3A8080%2Femb-page-one.html&logLevel=trace&embPathParam=%23%2F&embeddingScriptV=2

      Doesn't work, iframe lost

    "Active|Popular|New"
      —>  http://e2e-test-www.localhost:8080/new?embHow=Forum&embgUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fe2e-test-www.localhost%3A8080%2Femb-page-one.html&logLevel=trace&embPathParam=%23%2F&embeddingScriptV=2

      Doesn't work, iframe lost
  
SECURITY; COULD make [which endpoints are allowed in an embedded forum] configurable.
F.ex. some communities might want direct messages to be allowed only if accessing
the forum directly (not embedded), see:  GroupTalkController.sendMessage().
But that's overdoing it, for now.

[cache_embg_url]
Cache html per embedding url, and then do include embedding url & origin in the cached pages?
See:  page_html_cache_t.param_embg_url_or_empty_c.
Actually, no, don't cache the embedding url. Instead, we need to cache only the embUrlParam!,
that is, page_html_cache_t.param_embd_url_param_c.

Thereafter, can solve the  [TyLink_problems]?

Emb forum iframe:
    UX BUG: Doesn't downsize itself, if emb forum.


If non-existing page, e.g.:  https://www.ex.co/forum#/non-existing-page, then don't open
a login popup in the iframe, just results in:
      Login dialog in emb iframe [TyE5KER2]
