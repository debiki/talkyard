Alias = anonym or pseudonym.
- Anonyms are per page.
- Pseduonyms (a.k.a pen names) can be reused accross pages and categories.
- Depending on the community, one can have just one pseudonym at a time, or <= N,
    or maybe only one in a specific category.
- Can in rare cases make sense to disallow posting & interacting w others using one's
  true account — instead, must always be via a pseudonym.


Left to do
-----------------------

Quick:
  - RENAME // to ...ByTrueId?
    val anonsByRealId = anons.groupBy(_.anonForPatId)

  - Code review:
    - tests/e2e-wdio7/specs/alias-anons-basic.2br.f.e2e.ts
    - tests/e2e-wdio7/specs/alias-anons-true-mixed.2br.f.e2e.ts

Minor & medium:
  - Notifications: List notifications to all one's aliases (anonyms & pseudonyms),
    not just to oneself.
  - Actions: List comments & pages by one's aliases, on one's recent comment page
    (but of course others, not even mods or admins, can see this).
  - Authz.scala:  [_pass_alias] [deanon_risk]
  - Reuse getAliasOrTruePat() everywhere  [get_anon]
  - Accept/unaccept answer
  - Close/reopen page
  - Delete/undelete own page
  - Rename page
  - mayEditPage(.., asAlias, ...) in PageTitleSettingsController  [may_use_alias]
  - Flag (report) things anonymously?
  - Search for all DO_AS_ALIAS
  - Search for all ANON_UNIMPL

(Also see: [anon_pages])

Later:
  - Ask the server which alias to use, instead of deriving client side [fetch_alias]
    e.g. if the page is big?  Also prevents any misbehaving clients.
  - Incl true id in json dumps, depending on site sensitivity settings  [export_privid]
    Maybe add sth like talkyard.server.parser.JsonConf that says if any doerId.privId
    should be included or not?  SensitiveConf or PrivacyConf maybe?
  - Suspending: If an anonym posts say toxic comments and gets reported, then,
    can't suspend the underlying true user — that'd leak info about who the
    anonym is?  Instead, the anonym would get banned, and the true user
    prevented from creating new anonyms. Likewise, with pseudonyms?
  - Think about anonymous votes and how many have read this-or-that comment,
    when the same person visits & comments sometimes as hanself, sometimes
    using an alias.  See: PagePopularityCalculator  [alias_vote_stats]
  - [pseudonyms_later] [pseudonyms_trust]
  - [anon_priv_msgs][anon_chats]
  - [sql_true_id_eq]
    Look at later, realted to anonyms and pseudonyms (looking up on both true id & anon id).

Tests missing:
  /^alias/  in test-map.txt.

Large:
  - Alias selector (see below)
  - Dim buttons

  - Anonymous moderator actions  [anon_mods]:  Let mods do things anonymously,
    but using different per-page-&-user anons, so no one can see if
    replies by an anon, are in fact by one of the mods (if that anon later did
    sth only mods can do). — Look at all `getAliasOrTruePat()` and [get_anon].

  - Group aliases / post as group?  [group_pseudonyms]
    So many people can post, using the same name.
    E.g. all teachers in a school might want to appear as "Teacher",
    or support staff as "Support" without any individual name.
    Is it better to "just" use the group's name & username,
    or should groups be able to have a pseudonyms?


For sensitive discussions
=======================


Alias selector  [alias_mode] [choose_alias]
-----------------------
A preferred-alias selector in one's upper right username menu, which determines
which of one's aliases gets used, in places where one can post as:
  - Oneself
  - A pseudonym
  - Anonymously

If you comment or vote on a page where you have used another alias that the one
currently selected (in the alias selector),  then, Talkyard asks:
  "You previously commented here as X,  but you've activated pseudonym Y.
    Continue commenting as X?   [yes, as X  /  no, as Y  /  cancel]"

And, since Y is a somewhat unlikely answer, then dobuble check:
  "Ok, you'll appear as Y   [yes, fine  /  no, cancel]"

Or, if the current mode is Anonymous, and you visit a discussion where you've
replied as yourself previously, and you hit Reply, then, a dialog:

   "Continue using your real name in this discussion? [y / n]
   You're in Anonymous mode but on this page you've used your real name previously."

(Might seem as if this double check question is an extra step, but it'll almost
never happen that anyone replies as X and later on what to continue as Y in the
same discussion. — Maybe shouldn't even be allowed; could be a config setting.)


Dim buttons
-----------------------
When a not-oneself alias has been selected, then, all buttons that don't work
with alias mode, could be dimmed a bit?  For example, if one is a moderator,
an Approve Comment button wouldn't be anonymous (unless anonymous moderator
actions have been implemented & activated)

so if you're a mod, and you've choosen Anonymous, then a Delete Page button
would be dimmed, because you cannot delete the page anonymously (unless
it's your page).

And if you click it, there'll be a modal popup?
    """You can't do this [anonymously / as Pseudonym-Name].
       Do using your true account? [y / N]"""
and a tips about switching back to one's true account.

Will need a PermsOnPage for both oneself, and any currently selected alias?
Buttons one can click oneself, but one's alias cannot, would be dimmed?
And if clicking, a dialog pop up, e.g.:
    "You cannot do that anonymously. Use your real account? [y / N]"
Buttons one cannot click at all, aren't shown. Buttons one can click as one's
alias, are displayed as usual (not dimmed).)


Think about
-----------------------
- Pseudonyms: [not_use_true_users], when deciding if they should get notified?
  But isn't that similar to deciding if it's risky for that same pseudonym to _post_
  something  in the relevant category?

- [pseudonym_types]
  Should a pseudonym inherit the permissions of the underlying true user?
  Pros: More user friendly, probably how people expect things to work.
        Can grant pseudonymous access to only higher trust level users, or users a specific group.
  Cons: Simpler for others to guess who a pseudonym is, based on what restricted categories
        han has access to. — If this is a problem, depends on e.g.:
        - How many [user groups with different category permission combinations] there are.
        - How many users and their activity.
  Can even make sense with different types of pseudonyms?
    - One "type" that has the same access permissions as one's true account?
    - Another that doesn't inherit anything from one's true account?
      But can instead be granted permissions independently of one's true account.
      This, though, is more like a completely separate account, but you access it
      by first logging in to your true account, then switching accounts.


Guessing who is who?  [deanon_risk]
-----------------------
- People's slightly unique writing style can be a "problem", can be mitigated by letting
  an AI transform all anon comments to a similar writing style.
- In a small forum: Sbd being active in the middle of the night, and some anonymous
  comments from the same time span, otherwise just silence the whole night. Repeated a few
  times, then, easy to make a good guess about who posted the anon comments. — Mitigated
  by hiding last-active-at & posted-at timestamps, or making timestamps coarse-grained,
  e.g. showing only day or week (but not hour and minute).
- Inherits permissions — see [pseudonym_types] below.
- 9999 more things...

When posting anonymously, often safer to [not_use_true_users]' permissions.


Lots of work
-----------------------
- Joint decisions  [joint_decisions]
- When about to do sth using an alias, count how many others in the forum that can do
  that same thing, and if it's less than X, then show a notice:
    """Only Y people can post a comment here. Others might guess who you are.
    Proceed anyway? [y / n]"""
- If admins configure categories so there's small groups with unique sets of permissions,
  and pseudonyms allowed: Maybe tell the admins that it's possible to make pretty
  good guesses about who the pseudonyms are?
- If repeatedly doing very different things that few others can do,
  using the same pseudonym, then what? Calculate total % likelihood that someone
  correctly guesses their true identidy, looking at all past actions, and if too high,
  consider switching to a new pseudonym?  — Maybe simpler to just suggest that
  the user switches to a new pseudonym after N time units or M interactions/comments.


Would be nice
-----------------------
- Pass doer (usually the author)  and  trueDoer  to NotificationGenerator,
  so won't need to lookup inside.    [notf_pass_doer]


Unnecessary
-----------------------
- If an admin Alice impersonates Bob, then, even if Bob's list of aliases are hidden
  (so Alice can't see them),  it can still be partly possible for Alice to figure out
  which aliases are Bob's aliases — by looking at when Bob did *not* get notified about
  a comment, namely if one of Bob's aliases replied on one of Bob's pages, and
  Bob ought to have gotten notidied but didn't  (Talkyard won't currently notify
  sbd about *their own* anonymous comments.)  [notfs_trueid_check]

  However, it's better to restrict impersonation? So [joint_decisions] are needed
  to impersonate anyone  (say, >= 2 admins need to agree) combined with
  impersonation notifications  [imp_notfs].

- One person with [many_anons_per_page].  (Except for anonymous moderation, but maybe
  a shared moderator pseudonym is better.)
