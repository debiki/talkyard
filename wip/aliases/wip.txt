Alias = anonym or pseudonym.
- Anonyms are per page.
- Pseduonyms (a.k.a pen names) can be reused accross pages and categories.
- Depending on the community, one can have just one pseudonym at a time, or <= N,
    or maybe only one in a specific category.
- Can in rare cases make sense to disallow posting & interacting w others using one's
  true account — instead, must always be via a pseudonym.

Tests missing:  /^alias/

Think about:
- Pseudonyms: [not_use_true_users], when deciding if they should get notified?
  But isn't that similar to deciding if it's risky for that same pseudonym to _post_
  something  in the relevant category?


Lots of work:
- Joint decisions  [joint_decisions]
- When about to do sth using an alias, count how many others in the forum that can do
  that same thing, and if it's less than X, then show a notice:
    """Only Y people can post a comment here. Others might guess who you are.
    Proceed anyway? [y / n]"""
- If admins configure categories so there's small groups with unique sets of permissions,
  and pseudonyms allowed: Maybe tell the admins that it's possible to make pretty
  good guesses about who the pseudonyms are?
- If repeatedly doing very different things that few others can do,
  using the same pseudonym, then what? Calculate total % likelihood that someone
  correctly guesses their true identidy, looking at all past actions, and if too high,
  consider switching to a new pseudonym?  — Maybe simpler to just suggest that
  the user switches to a new pseudonym after N time units or M interactions/comments.



Minor:
- Pass doer (usually the author)  and  trueDoer  to NotificationGenerator,
  so won't need to lookup inside.    [notf_pass_doer]


Unnecessary:
- If an admin Alice impersonates Bob, then, even if Bob's list of aliases are hidden
  (so Alice can't see them),  it can still be partly possible for Alice to figure out
  which aliases are Bob's aliases — by looking at when Bob did *not* get notified about
  a comment, namely if one of Bob's aliases replied on one of Bob's pages, and
  Bob ought to have gotten notidied but didn't  (Talkyard won't currently notify
  sbd about *their own* anonymous comments.)  [notfs_trueid_check]

  However, it's better to restrict impersonation? So [joint_decisions] are needed
  to impersonate anyone  (many admins need to agree) combined with
  impersonation notifications  [imp_notfs].
