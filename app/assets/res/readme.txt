/*{{{ Bug avoidance notes

For an <a>, use this.hash not $(this).attr('href'), because in IE 7
attr() prepends 'http://server/.../page' to the href.  Related:

/* {{{ Misc naming notes

 dwCoSid:
  "dw" is a prefix, avoids name clashes.
  "Co" means "Cookie".
  "Sid" is the cookie name.

 dwEvLoggedInOut:
  "Ev" means "event".
  "LoggedInOut" is the event.

 So you can do: grep dwCo, grep dwEv

 HTML5 data attributes names:  ??
 Like the CSS class names, but underscore not hyphen, so as to aovid
 uppercase/hyphen conversion. (E.g. 'data-variable-name' is converted to
 variableName (no hyphen, uppercase 'N'), and back, according to the html5
 spec: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#
          embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes>
 Using underscoer ensures the data names in the html doc matches
 the names in the Javascript source code which avoids confusion.
 Example:  zd_t_id  means:  folded (zd, 'z' is fold)  thread (t)  id (id).
 But don't use:  zd-t-id, that'd be converted to 'zdTId' I think.
 If the data is only set and read via Javascript (never serialized to html),
 then please use 'dwDataName' (then you know you need only consider the
 javascript files (this file) should you want to rename it).)

 Let names of functions that return a jQuery object end with $.
 Let names of functions that should be passed to jQuery.each start with $.
 Let jQuery objects start with $.
 Currently jQuery extensions are prefixed by 'dw', e.g. $post.dwAuthorId().
 Example:
   var $header = d.i.findPostHeader$(postId);
   $header.each($doSomething);
