@* FIXED Chrome 64, Jan 2018. DO_AFTER 2018-08-12 remove this workaround
This fails in Chrome 63, although the opener's origin is the same,
because of this Chrome bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=796912
- In an embedded discussion iframe,
- click Reply or Flag, so login popup opens,
- in the popup, login with Gmail *when you're not logged in already in Gmail* so that
    you need to type your email & password in the Gmail login dialogs.
- then, after you're done logging in to Gmail, and the popup redirects back to the html here,
   we won't be allowed to access window.opener. Although we're back on the original domain (!),
   same as the iframe (the iframe is window.opener). Work around: [4PKGTEW20]

function returnToOpener() {
  try { // try = because the Chrome bug, see above [4PKGTEW20].

      queryString: (window.location+'').split('?')[1],
