@* TODO RENAME to showCreateUserDialogInThisWindow.scala.html    *@

@(tpi: debiki.SiteTpi, serverAddress: String,
    origNonceBack: String, idpName: String, idpHasVerifiedEmail: Boolean,
    newUserUsername: String, newUserFullName: String, newUserEmail: String,
    authDataCacheKey: String, anyContinueToUrl: Option[String])

@* After authentication at an Identity Provider (IDP) in this popup window,
 * we show a create user dialog, in this same popup window.
 * This is 1) for embedded comments pages — then, login and user creation always
 * happens in a login popup window (this window), because wouldn't work well
 * to show a create user dialog in Talkyard's iframe on the blog page.
 * And 2) for logging in in the whole main window, to e.g. the admin area, or if the
 * site requires login.
 *
 * So don't call window.close() here. But in closePopupShowCreateUserDialog.scala.html
 * we do the same things and *also* call window.close(),
 * and continue in the opener instead, by showing the create-user dialog, there.
