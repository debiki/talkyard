  Facebook mobile app problem?
</p>
<p>
  Did you go to here, via Facebook's mobile app?
  If so, you're likely using Facebook's built-in browser. It makes things break.

  @* Previously, this was caused by a Chrome v 63 bug, since long fixed (by Google).
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=796912
  and a workaround was needed here: [4PKGTEW20]. Google added, and fixed, the bug in
  Dec-Jan-Feb 2017, 2018.  *@
</p>
<p>
  Instead, copy the login URL, and log in outside Facebook.
  (Or outside any other mobile app you're using, if not Facebook?)
