/** There might be many reasons to review something, so the review reason is a 2**x integer
  * so that many reasons can be combined in one single Long and stored in one single
  * database field. Examples:
  *   NewPost —> not reviewed —> edited = NewPost.toInt & PostEdited.toInt
  *   (i.e. a new post --> review reason New Post.
  *    then someone edits it --> review reason PostEdited, too.
  *    So now there are two reasons to review it (but only one review task, so
  *    the staff will just review the post once).)
