/* Disabled. Uses Post, it's gone, now it's Post2.

/** Given a sequence of pinnings of posts, calculates the resulting positions
  * of all pinned posts. Used by PageParts.
  *
  * For example, if posts A, B, and C are pinned like this, then this happens:
  * A at position 1 --> [A]     (that is, A first, on position 1, and nothing else pinned)
  * B at position 1 --> [B, A]  (that is, B pushes A from position 1 to position 2)
  * C at position 2 --> [B, C, A]
  * C at position 3 --> [B, A, C]
  *
  * Currently requires that all pinned posts have been loaded, otherwise
  * some intermediate derived positions will be wrong (for example,
  * if you load only 5 pinned posts, and then pin a post at position 10,
  * it'll be pinned at position 6 — just after all currently known pinned posts).
