    * where 123 is a public key in base 10 or 16 or 32.
    * For example, if there're two identities on planet Earth with public key 23456785384306...
    * and 2309284833237..., they can have the same username, and will get the suffixes 234 and 230,
    * respectively. So, their usernames would be: @same_username_234 and @same_username_230
    * (The public key number could be Scuttlebutt public keys, that is, the public part of
    * an ed25519 key pair.)
    *
    * '_' isn't allowed in domain names currently anyway.
    *
    * NO remove this. Use a magic char to show that the rest of the username is a globally
    * unique identity? This is how Scuttlebut stores username links:
    *   "@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519"
    * So better if e.g.:  "alice_@123abc=.ed25519" is Alice's local + globally unique username,
    * rather than just "alice_123abc".
