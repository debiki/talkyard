    // play.api.libs.streams.ActorFlow

    // However, seems it'd use more memory and resources (creates an unneeded
    // actor), and is more complicated: 1) Needs to wait until an Actor
    // onStart() overridable fn has been called, to get an ActorrRef.
    // And 2) seems the Actor does some buffering of outgoing messages, but
    // I want to do that myself, to be able to re-send if the user disconnects
    // and reconnects shortly thereafter — but if the messages were buffered
    // in a per WebSocket actor, they'd be lost?
    // And 3) there's a memory retention leak bug risk? From the docs (May 2020):
    // """Note that terminating the actor without first completing it, either
    // with a success or a failure, will prevent the actor triggering downstream
    // completion and the stream will continue* to run even though
    // the source actor is dead. Therefore you should **not** attempt to
    // manually terminate the actor such as with a [[akka.actor.PoisonPill]]
