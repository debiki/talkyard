rename perms_on_pages to  page_perms  ?
   no ... instead,  perms_on_pages, perms_on_cats, perms_on_tags. ?


split  page_users into:
  - page_pats_t    — maybe  is_assigned?
  - page_visits_t
  - page_notf_prefs_t

users3 -> pats_t


could have:  cat_perms_t  and tag_perms_t
but that's overkill.
Only  tag_label_perms.may_use  makes sense (says who may add/remove a tag with that label)


[page_pps_t] Maybe a table with member notf prefs and joined = true/false?
And change page_users3 to page_reading_progrs_t only?
The notf prefs table could be split into one for pages — namely page_pps_t
— and one for categories:  cat_pps_t?
But the current approach with page_users3 and page_notf_prefs3 is fairly ok too.
