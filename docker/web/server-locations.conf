# ----- Uploads

# The app server saves uploads to the directory indicated below, and here we configure Nginx

# if it's ok for the client to download it.

# The path looks like: /-/u/pub-site-id/hash-path.
# There're older backw compat paths too [6FKW24].
# Bind regex captures to named variables ('pubSiteId', 'hashPath') because apparently the
# nested regex location (the one for mp4|m4v|m4a) "overwrites" $1, $2, $3 with its own captures.

  # as an internal error. So it cannot both do auth, and check does-it-exist? at the same time.

  # a response is received — but meanwhile, the nginx worker continues with other things.)
