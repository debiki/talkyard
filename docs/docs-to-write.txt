How use Talkyard as a blog: how to prevent users from creating new topics, only letting them comment on existing topics created by admins.
(1 person asked)
Ans: click the category, then security settings.

Hmm maybe the edit category button = hidden, if categories disabled?
Then one cannot edit security settings o.O

How export JSON & uploads from a Talkyard server, and import to another server?
(1 person asked)
Ans: Not yet implemented.
Some work has been done: ImportExportController can import JSON and is used by the test suites.
However, needs to be able to import more "detailed" things, & more types of objs, & also export.


URL fragment action API, e.g.:
http://site.localhost/forum/#composeTopic&category=slug:ideas

How import Disqus comments? How import WordPress comments?
(1 + 1 person asked)
Ans: Not yet possible. Planning to support.




Can admin view direct messages?
Ans: Yes.
If someone for example posts illegal content via direct messages, or spam or toxic messages,
then admins need to be able to investigate.


Rich text editor? Emojis?
Ans: Yes, soon (maybe August 2018). I'm thinking about using ProseMirror. Emojis: will have to wait a bit more. Meanwhile, use `:-)` :- )

How do I do a manual backup?
For the SaaS hosted version: You'll be able to export your community in JSON, see below.
For self hosted version, you can export JSON, and also do a full database backup:
`cd /opt/talkyard ;  .... `

How do I configure automatic backups?
Backups happen daily, for the SaaS hosted version, and also if you install yourself and
follow the instructions (a cron job runs the backup script daily).

Can one export the community in JSON?
Ans: Not yet. There'll be a button that forum owners can click, to export their community
in a `.tar.gz` zip file (?), and therein, there'll be a JSON file with all topics, comments, and users.
Plus all uploaded files, e.g. images.

(Details: Probably one will be able to export a .tar.gz file, which includes a JSON file with all topics & comments & users etcetera, and all uploaded files (images etcetera). I've started a little bit: The end-to-end tests import JSON files to create test communities.)
