When doing these things, search for the tag too e.g. "[subcats]".

[subcats]
Implement sub categories.

[privacy-badger]:
Privacy Badger doesn't like transient session cookies, currently.
(See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/2003#issuecomment-391745819  bullet point 3. )
So maybe change from csrf Double Submit Cookie, to Encrypted Token Pattern?

[no-email]:
Let people create accounts without specifying any email address. Like at Reddit.


[reenable-akismet]:
For some reason I disabled Akismet (why? when refactoring to save time?). Enable it again.


[flat-comments]:
Change layout of problem type topics to traditional forum flat comments layout.
& use for formal messages too, or maybe repl w chat?


[relfollow]:
Add a 'rel=follow links to domains: ...' config value,
so peope can follow links to their own domains.
Domains where rel=nofollow should not be added to links.
Will be applied to sub domains too, e.g. if you type `ex.com`, `sub.ex.com` will also
have rel=nofollow removed.
You should add the address of this forum, and your main website (if any),
so search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu will find all content.


[rand-page-id], [rand-user-id]:
Let outwardly visible page and user ids, be random numbers, to prevent
discovery of pages & people by iterating through all ids in the url.
64 bit random ids? or 32 bits + stricter rate limiting?

[custom-groups]
Search for that tag.

[subcomms]
Improve sub communities, e.g. selecting a category across all sub communities,
not only the current one.

[canonical-username]
[CANONUN] [5WKB23Z]
Rename theUsername to exactUsername? — it'll be how the username is displayed,
e.g. `jane_doe` or `jane.doe`, and always possible to login with that exact username.
Add canonicalUsername, which is: lowercase, and /[._-]+/ changed to '_'
so there's nothing but: [a-z0-9_]+ left.
By default, one can type whatever [_.-] when logging in, and it'll be first checked against
the exact username, and then [_.-]+ changed to '_' and compared with the canonical username.
And won't be able to create new accounts that have the same canonical useranme, as an already existing.
So logging in as Jane Doe works with: 'jane.doe', 'jane-doe', 'jane_doe'. And also for mentions,
so all these work: `@jane.doe @jane-doe @jane_doe` — it'll be the same person.
However, `jan.edoe` is someone else. That canonical username is different ('_' in a different place).

[canonical-email]
Avoid accidentally splitting an account into two, because sometimes '.' sometimes no '.'
when logging in with Gmail. Also, @gmail.com and @googlemail.com are the same.
https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10313?hl=en
Real life example of this happening:
https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-creates-new-users-if-dots-are-present-absent-in-google-email-address-when-logging-in-using-google/66151
Good approach?: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51344711/694469

Add canonical email? [canonical-email] So  dotty.addr.ess@googlemail also
saved as  dottyaddress@gmail.com, and if logs in with or without dots,
we'll know it's the same person? However, if types  some.name+tags@gmail.com,
then one *intentionally* added +something, and then treat as separate addr?
so can create different accounts for testing. (Spam detection could just
be aware that x+something and x+something2 and x+... are all the same accounts.)
If not, then sometimes people sign up manually, say, without dots. And then,
later, the community adds Gmail OpenAuth, and the same person signs in
with Google, and Google sends the addr via OpenAuth *with* dots, and this would
result in two different accounts for the same person, and confusion ("Where are
all my old posts?").

[one-db-writer]
Prevent all PostgreSQL serialization errors, by doing all writes from a single actor, and
use message passing & async replies?
