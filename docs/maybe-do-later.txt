In this file: Features and fixes to maybe implement in the future.
Each issue starts with a "code tag", e.g.:  [subcats]
which you can search for across the whole code base, to find some-of / all-of
the relevant source code places to change.

[emburl_emgurl] [prefix_diid]
Change from emburl:.. to emgurl:..  no, to  emgurllax:.. and emgurlexact:...  ?
And prefix w 'diid:' in alt_page_ids3. Rename to page_(lookup)_keys_t?


Instead of this file, maybe use a combination of:
 - https://github.com/dspinellis/git-issue   wow! and source code with  {{ {1  vi folds
 (- https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes? )
 (- https://github.com/google/git-appraise )

[dynamic_max_limits][rate_limits]
SHOULD NEXT: Make these limits configurable at runtime, and trigger superadmin notifications
when exceeded 50%, so can review and bump. And warnings if exceeds 75%, 90%.

[first_last_apr_at]
Fix sort order bug: Add Post.firstApprovedAt.

[timeline_comts] Maybe. Rename "progress posts" to "timeline comments"?

[ty_themes]
Primary button colors, secondary, background, arrows, fonts,
and embedded widgets, e.g. Twitter's oEmbed has a 'link_color: #223344' attr,
                            and  theme=light/dark.

[post_owners] posts_t.owners_id_c — if ownership of a post has been transferred.
The new owner can, but the original author can't, edit it and delete it etc.

[post_authors] if many authors, or different from the creator.

[post_rels_t] New table, will store relationships between posts and whatever, e.g.
post A is-answer-to post Q (could be many answers), multireplies, here.

[drafts_as_posts] Move drafts from drafts3 to posts_t?

[flags_as_posts] Move flags from  post_actions3 to  posts_t, and use a future
table  post_rels_t  to link to flagged posts or user accounts.
Why? See <./tyworld.adoc>, the Flag Pages and Posts section.

[pat_rels_t]  Rename & change post_actions3  to  pat_rels_t, and store
votes and AssignedTo there.

[perms_on_pats_t] Rename group_participants3 to perms_on_pats_t, for consistency.

[cluster_tables] Cluster posts_t on page id, and *_rels_t on the from_.. or to_.. id?
So all posts and links needed to render a page can get loaded quickly.
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-cluster.html 


[wiki_links] — link to Ty page via its name, like at Wikipedia etc.
Stored in links_t, just like "text text  <a href=...>" text links.

[wiki_perms] [new_perms]
Make page props, e.g. answer-post, doing-status, page type, etc wiki-editable?
Rather than only individually, per post / comment.
Wikifiable things: Title, properties (doing-status, answer-post etc), Orig Post, replies.
What should be wiki-editable? Just the Orig Post? Or also replies, or page-props?
Probably per post (e.g. per OP or comment) is a good default / what people expect?
Maybe split "Wikify" into "Wikify text" and "Wikify properties" and "Wikify all"? Hmm

There could be a separate: May-wikify-own-posts permission,  and May-wikify-others-posts?
Indicating that somwhat granular permission control of a posts props can make sense?

[page_props_perms]
If pat 1) may edit the Orig Post text, and if pat 2) may change the page type, doing-status
etc, maybe should be different permissions? Or not?

[staff_can_see]
Add a black hanglock next to things one can see, because of one's extra
access permissions? E.g. editing category settings, or backlinks from
access restricted topics.

[admin_log]
Make site specific errors visible to site admins — so no need
to have Linux root access.

[logger_everywhere]
Pass loggers to the models and rdb Scala modules, so they don't need to use
System.stdout/stderr directly.

[immutable]
Make all js objs "light weight immutable", via Typescript's 'readonly' properties:
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#readonly-properties
(React wants immutable.)

[add_nodes_t]
Merge  posts3, pages3, categories3 and some settings3 columns into:  nodes_t
(which will actually be posts3 but renamed, and with some new columns).
See: docs/everything-is-a-node.txt .

[subcats] [sub_cats]
DONE: Implement sub categories.
But missing: Search in sub cats, if searching in base cat.

[forum_page]
More configurable, & discussions too, see:  y2999/wip_sect_disc_props_views_stats.sql

[watchbar_to_linkbar]
RENAME the "watchbar" to "linkbar", the page meta bar to "pagebar", and the right
sidebar to "contextbar" ?

[propagate_cat_perms]
It'd be nice if there was a way to get an overview of sub cat permissions,
when looking at a base cat. And if one could propagate the base category's
permissions to all/some sub cats.
Also make this work for the root cat? So one can get an overview of permission
settings for *all* base cats and sub cats in the whole forum — a cat permissions
table-tree, somehow. [incl_root_cat]

[may_not_perms]
Currently permissions are additive. Maybe, though, in some cases it'd be good
with "negative" permissions — e.g. a group that may Not something.
Then, everyone in that group, would be forbidden from doing that something,
regardless of how they inherited permissions from other groups.

[granular_perms]
E.g. may-see-others'-sessions. Currently only amdins may, but sometimes, good if mods could too?

[power_mod]

[tags]
Nice props / tags in Gerrit: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/2537690

[missing_tags_feats]
Wasn't fixed in first iteration.
+ search by content tags, incl in ElasticSearch index (faceted search).
+ orig post author user flair (badge).
+ might as well add search-by-user-id/username/full-name at the same time?
  And upgr ES to 7.x.
+ search for all JsUser(_) — then tags (badges) not included.
+ get notified about posts w tags one follows
+ for some endpoints, [tags_and_badges_missing]
+ access restricted tags [priv_tags]


[sw] [sse]
DONE: Service worker.  No, skip, using Websocket instead of:  Server sent events.

[spam]
When deleting a post, ask if it's because it's spam. If yes, and the post
hasn't been spam checked — send it to the spam check services so they'll
get more training data. [DELSPAM] (Currently, only if the post has already
been spam checked, will it get sent back to the spam check service,
if there was a classification error.)

If many posts by a new user are classified as spam. Or if staff deletes most of hens
posts, during review. Then mark user as a moderate threat. [DETCTTHRT]

FIXED, now uses 1st party cookie or storage: [privacy-badger]:
Privacy Badger doesn't like transient session cookies, currently.
(See https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/2003#issuecomment-391745819  bullet point 3. )
So maybe change from csrf Double Submit Cookie, to Encrypted Token Pattern?
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Encrypted_Token_Patternp

[gdpr]
New table: sessions_t, impl fn deletePersonalDataFromOldSessions().  [sess_deleted_ix]

[pps]
Rename User to Participant and User to Member.  Participant = Guest or Member, Member = User or Group.
Rename variables named like "member" to "user", "memberOrGroup" to "member", "user" to "participant"
Rename "indie" to user" and "people" to "members"

[private_chats] Later.

[private_pats][some_pub_priv_prefs]  Unlisted / less-visible / "hidden"? users?
So cannot see / list users unless has access to the same categories, or is in
the same group(s) or high enough trust level or sth like that?
The opposite: Easy to find pats, e.g.:
      type ' @' and the '@support' group is suggested [mentions_prio_c].

[tech_level] Let users configure their tech level — let's say sbd who knows all about
Ty joins a new forum. Then, although a New Member, hen can up hens tech level and get
access to features the software otherwise would have thought were too complicated.
Store in pats_t.tech_level_c.

[inherit_group_priv_prefs]
One should inherit privacy and noise settings from one's closest trust level group,
and from any custom group one is in? But one's own settings should override.

[user_version] [tag_versions]
Add a version field to pats_t and an in-mem user? So knows if the in-mem one is stale;
then, the browser shouldn't use it, if it already has a newer version.
Also add tagtype_t.version_c  and tags_t.version_c, so we'll know, client side,
for these too, which one is the most up-to-date, or equally up-to-date, if we have two.


[security]
prevent usernames from being displayed in Unicode, if mixed charsets used,
e.g. Latin + Cryllic = facebooĸ.com  (homograph attacks).

Switch to firewalld.

use gVisor / runsc or Firecracker.
See: https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/

Optionally encrypt off-site backups? Maybe:  https://github.com/borgbackup/borg
    (plus instructions to copy the backup encryption key!)
    Seems ppl like it:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21642364  "the holy grail"
      rsync.net

Add CSP to all page types / routes: CSP_MISSING, [script_src_self].

ZAProxy auto scan.
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/index.html

[repr_builds]
Reproducible builds.

[rate_limits][to_rate_lim]
Configurable rate limits.

[precompile_luajit]  COULD_OPTIMIZE  SKIP, instead [use_pingora]
See: https://blog.openresty.com/en/luajit-bytecode/
Many times faster startup time, hopefully uses less memory too?

[server_limits] [site_limits]
If admins try to configure too "high" values, e.g. 1 TB upload size,
need a way for them to know they're above the server or site limits,
e.g. the Nginx client_max_body_size.

[more_runtime_assertions]
Figure out a way to safely add more runtime assertions — although sometimes
I'll add *incorrect assertions* some of which will *break* and need to
be disabled.

[authn]
What about adding U2F login?
https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/ — a Java U2F / WebAuthn lib.

Adding more authn methods:
When logged in, click an Add-another-login-method button. Then choose between
e.g. Gmail, GitHub etc, and after logging in there, add that identity
to the user account.
That's how e.g. StackOverflow does this:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6487418/
       how-to-handle-multiple-openids-for-the-same-user

[oidc_missing]:  some more nice OIDC things.



[srv_glb_idp]
Link to server global idp:
  * @param idpSiteId — None, unless is from a server global
  *   authn site, with e.g. shared Gmail or Facebook OIDC or OAuth2 config,
  *   and that authn site id is different from the current site id.
Aha!? I'll just add is_server_global_c and guid_c fields to idp_t,
and change idtys_t.conf_file_idp_id_c to lookup IDPs both via conf file,
and idps_t.guid_c. And rename conf_file_idp_id_c to glob_idp_guid.
Migrate to ScribeJava, [migr_to_scribejava]


[per_site_email_domain]
Optionally configure email settings in the admin area, per site.

[no-email]:
Let people create accounts without specifying any email address. Like at Reddit.

[many_emails] [email_privacy]
Let someone create many accounts with the same email address.
Also then one cannot try to find out if an account exists,
by specifying that person's email addr.
And when logging in via email, one gets to choose which account to login to.

[known_verified_email_domains]
      // + known all-email-addrs-have-been-verified email domains from site settings?

[clean_up_emails]
Refactor a bit.
Search for:  [4KDPREU2], break out fn.


[reenable-akismet]:
For some reason I disabled Akismet (why? when refactoring to save time?). Enable it again.
Conf vals for enable/disable: check ip addr, country, sign-up email addr, aksimet,
toxicity/content-filter, image scan, other uploads / check hashsums, outgoing links.

[hard_deletes]

[undel_pages]
DONE: Should remember who deleted it, so can see one's own deleted pages and undelete them,
but cannot seem one's own pages if instead they got deleted by staff.
In fact, all pages_t.deleted_at, frozen_at,  etc,
   should instead be   deleted_by, frozen_by, etc
   — because always good to remember who did it; often, that person may undo (+ staff).
   But *when*, that's for the audit log.
Missing: Improve the UX.

[undel_posts] [62AKDN46] [apr_deld_post] [apr_movd_orig_post]
Undelete posts, not just pages and categories.
And make it possible to change from  Rejected —> Approved,
and Approved —> Rejected,  unless got replies or Like votes already?
Need an approvalStatus [ApprovedStatus] field?
 -3 = rejected by staff
 -2 = rejected by staff, approved by system  (+1 -3 = -2)
 -1 = auto blocked by system (e.g. spam)
  0 = undecided
  1 = auto approed by system
  2 = approved/reviewed by staff, but initially auto-blocked by system (-1 +3 = 2)
  3 = approved/reviewed by staff
Or:  0,1,2 = undec, apr, rej by sys.  4,8,16 by trusted,  core member,  32,64,128 by staff  ?
   bits 1,2                           3,4                 5,6           7,8

[7YKU24] Stop auto approving chat messages.

[flat-comments]:
Change layout of problem type topics to traditional forum flat comments layout.
& use for formal messages too, or maybe repl w chat?

[editor-drafts]:
When starting a new topic, or editing a post, ask "Continue editing draft? [Yes, resume draft] [No, ignore draft (but keep it)]"
instead of always opening the old draft. Because otherwise sometimes old edits I didn't want, reappears.
How do that, UX wise? Maybe ask, when *opening* instead of when *saving*? and always
save a draft by default? Because maybe short of time when saving (e.g. need to run and
catch the subway, happens to me all the time) then it's annoying with questions.

[relfollow]:
Add a 'rel=follow links to domains: ...' config value,
so peope can follow links to their own domains.
Domains where rel=nofollow should not be added to links.
Will be applied to sub domains too, e.g. if you type `ex.com`, `sub.ex.com` will also
have rel=nofollow removed.
You should add the address of this forum, and your main website (if any),
so search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu will find all content.


[rand-page-id], [rand-user-id]:
Let outwardly visible page and user ids, be random numbers, to prevent
discovery of pages & people by iterating through all ids in the url.
64 bit random ids? or 32 bits + stricter rate limiting?

[custom-groups]
Search for that tag.

[pseudonyms_later][pseudonyms_trust]

[auto_deanon]
[auto_show_replies]
Needs: [add_triggers_t]

[deanon_risk]

[anon_priv_msgs][anon_chats]
Not now.

[sql_true_id_eq]
Look at later, realted to anonyms and pseudonyms.

[subcomms] [sub_communities]
Improve sub communities, e.g. selecting a category across all sub communities,
not only the current one.

[large_pages]
Support pages with 10 000+ replies or 10M replies.
(Some real life blog posts get 2M comments!)

[performance]
Use:  ch.qos.Logback.classic.AsyncAppender, measure req/s bef & aftr.
Nginx: error_log  debug vs warn.

Performance tests:
 "Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues."
 https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer

Test on real life anonymized data:  PostgreSQL Anonymizer?
   https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2017

[overcommit_memory]
Postgres might get OOM-killed if overcommit enabled. Maybe edit installation
instructions to disable overcommit?
vm.overcommit_memory = 2   (the default is 0 = yes)
vm.overcommit_ratio = 75   (how much, in %, of the mem + swap the kernel may overcommit)
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27794237 CloudSQL Postgres misconfigured OS OOM killer
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52148675/aws-rds-with-postgres-is-oom-killer-configured

[when_pg_smarter]
Can remove fk indexes?:
  tags_i_parentid_patid
  tags_i_parentid_postid
And these unique indexes:
  tags_u_id_patid
  tags_u_id_postid

[careless_rdb]  ty_crdb
Use a 2nd PostgreSQL server for a persistent mem + disk "cache"?
E.g. for session storage and user visit logs.
Set isolation level read-committed, https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html
and synchronous_commit = off,
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-async-commit.html
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT
and increase commit_delay
and set commit_siblings?
    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-COMMIT-DELAY
    See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58169528
see https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/42290/configuring-postgresql-for-read-performance
https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-vs-redis-vs-memcached-performance/
>  Asynchronous mode was used for writing data, meaning a slight loss of most recent data is possible in case of a server crash
Could move to the careless rdb?  "AC" means async-commits-probably-ok
    (Change the suffixes to "_ct", meaning "...cache table" or "... careless table".
    user_visit_stats3 AC
    page_html3  — is just a cache. AC
    user_stats3?
    spam_check_queue3
    sessions_t   — AC if a session is lost, all that happens is that one needs to log in again.
              When logging out, then, that transaction should be synchronous (not async) though.
    review_tasks3 — No! That's important, don't move to the careless rdb.
    post_read_stats3 AC ?
    page_popularity_scores3 ??
    link_previews_t AC — who cares if a Twitter tweet wasn't saved, has to be fetched again.
    index_queue3
    emails_out3
    audit_log3 — split in 2 parts maybe?  One less interesting, and one important?

[table_partitions]
Shard tables by site_id_c? {{{2
Needs pg11 (not pg10): In pg11, a parent table index gets auto-created on child tables
(both child tables that already existed, or get created after the index).
What happens when partitions created and there's data already?
Ans:
  > It is not possible to turn a regular table into a partitioned table or vice versa
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html
Ok, so partitioning means renaming the tables, and creating new, w partitions,
then copying the old data?
(Not needed in Ty's case, but pg11 supports updating rows and auto-moving
to the correct partition.)
Actually, needs pg12: foreign keys fully compatible with partitioned tables:
    can have partitioned table on either side of a foreign key constraint.
    (Ty's case: always both sides.)
    > for the first time it is possible in PostgreSQL to maintain large volumes
    > of data while maintaining referential integrity
    https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/postgresql-12-foreign-keys-and-partitioned-tables/
    pg11: enable_partitionwise_aggregate
Nice way to quickly delete a whole site: Just drop the whole partitioned tables.
  > very quickly delete millions of records because it doesn't have to individually delete every record

Pg12 has good partition pruning: at ~ 8k partitions, speed is ~90% of w just 1 table, and ~100% up to
about 2k partitions. https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/postgresql-12-partitioning/
}}}2

[cluster_tables]
Or, cluster tables — but:
  > when the table is subsequently updated, the changes are not clustered
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-cluster.html
  One can periodically recluster — but that requries an exclusive lock!
  However, clustering posts3 / posts_t by page_id_c = good idea.
  There is also:
  https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack, clustering without exclusive locks, a fork of:
    https://github.com/reorg/pg_reorg  (abandoned)


DONE [onesocket]
Subscribe to live-updates via a "shared web worker" so each browser gets its own connection,
rather than each browser tab.  See e.g.:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554896/sharing-websocket-across-browser-tabs
websearch for e.g. "chrome all tabs share websocket"


[canonical-username]
[CANONUN] [5WKB23Z]
Rename theUsername to exactUsername? — it'll be how the username is displayed,
e.g. `jane_doe` or `jane.doe`, and always possible to login with that exact username.
Add canonicalUsername, which is: lowercase, and /[._-]+/ changed to '_'
so there's nothing but: [a-z0-9_]+ left.
By default, one can type whatever [_.-] when logging in, and it'll be first checked against
the exact username, and then [_.-]+ changed to '_' and compared with the canonical username.
And won't be able to create new accounts that have the same canonical useranme, as an already existing.
So logging in as Jane Doe works with: 'jane.doe', 'jane-doe', 'jane_doe'. And also for mentions,
so all these work: `@jane.doe @jane-doe @jane_doe` — it'll be the same person.
However, `jan.edoe` is someone else. That canonical username is different ('_' in a different place).

[username-starts-with-_] ?
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/262f561a877e0296d7ca7f6ec9f27edd0d30ca8e
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/90351348ec3c0b1872aa680c0c9ddd5271e3740b
https://meta.discourse.org/t/usernames-with-periods-are-changed-to-underscore/17168/8  . –> _


[canonical-email]
Avoid accidentally splitting an account into two, because sometimes '.' sometimes no '.'
when logging in with Gmail. Also, @gmail.com and @googlemail.com are the same.
https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10313?hl=en
Real life example of this happening:
https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-creates-new-users-if-dots-are-present-absent-in-google-email-address-when-logging-in-using-google/66151
Good approach?: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51344711/694469

Add canonical email? [canonical-email] So  dotty.addr.ess@googlemail also
saved as  dottyaddress@gmail.com, and if logs in with or without dots,
we'll know it's the same person? However, if types  some.name+tags@gmail.com,
then one *intentionally* added +something, and then treat as separate addr?
so can create different accounts for testing. (Spam detection could just
be aware that x+something and x+something2 and x+... are all the same accounts.)
If not, then sometimes people sign up manually, say, without dots. And then,
later, the community adds Gmail OpenAuth, and the same person signs in
with Google, and Google sends the addr via OpenAuth *with* dots, and this would
result in two different accounts for the same person, and confusion ("Where are
all my old posts?").

[gmail_dot_dash_friendly]
Gmail ignores '-' and '.' in email addersses — Talkyard could do that too
for @gmail.com addresses. However maybe leave "+..." as is, since people add
that "magic suffix" intentionally.

[email_casing]
Talkyard already converts email to lowercase  before storing in the database.
However theoretically this is a small security risk,
in that if there is any email provider somewhere that treats
emails as case sensitive, then, people using that provider,
could try to hijack Ty accounts owned by other people using that same
dangerous email provider.  But any such email provider is unsafe
already because people who write emails, don't type casing properly
anyway (how is anyone supposed to remember to type "Jane.doe@..."
instead of "Jane.Doe@...") and would send emails to the wrong recipient
"all the time", so using such an email provider is a dangerous idea in
the first place?
SECURITY; COULD  send verification emails to any email addresses with
different casing, so all addresses involved get to confirm
that they're the same real life person.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9807909/are-email-addresses-case-sensitive
Discourse has case *in*sensitive emails:
https://meta.discourse.org/t/create-account-email-address-check-should-be-case-insensitive/15576/9
> This problem is fixed. Email is not case sensitive anymore!
Maybe skip this forever and move to decisions.adoc instead?


[one-db-writer]
Prevent all PostgreSQL serialization errors, by doing all writes from a single actor, and
use message passing & async replies?


[change-author]
Make it possible to change the author of a post to someone else. Or change edited-by to another user id.

[assign-posts]
Assign topics and posts to people. (Not only whole topics, but also comments/sub-threads inside topics.)
Why assign a post? Because someone might ask a good question, in a longer discussion, and nice
to know & remember who will try to answer it, later.

[can_see_assigned]
New permission.

[priv_comts] Private comments:
(Aka "whispers" in Discourse and "private items" in Basecamp long ago, and "private comments"
in other software.)
Add posts_t.private_pats_id_c, and a new participant type:  lists of pats,
to remember who can see private comments.
New permissions
        - Who may post/reply-to/delete private comments.
            Or no?  Instead, this'll be *the same* as who may post direct messages (DMs)
                  because private comments are *the same*, it's just that they
                  appear inline in another discussion, instead of on a separate page.
            So,  a single Who-may-post-private-messages setting that applies
            to both DMs and private comment sub threads.  [can_post_private_c]
        - Who may add, remove, manage users from/in private comment threads? Hmm.
          That'll be a  pats_t.how_private_c setting?
Ex: Privately talk with mods, directly next to the comment being discussed.
    Or a support group asks the Original Poster,
      in a support topic for tech details; then the maybe new-member can reply,
      and only other support staff can see hens tech details.
      (The UX would need to make it very clear that no one but staff can see the reply.)

Yes?: Private comments nrs can be big & random & < 0?
    Otherwise, people can look at post nrs and look after gaps in the number
    sequence (if > 0) and know that maybe there're private comment sub threads.

Don't incl priv comts when caching a page — only load lazily if current user can see.

Skip: Should there be a priv_comt_root_id so, if loading a descentant privt comt,
    it'd be immediately clear what post id to specify, to look up who can see that
    descendant priv comt? — Or load & look at all ancestors? Probably better,
    if a private thread is moved to another private thread but with different who-may-see
    — then, need to compute the intersection of who-can-see, to find out who can see
    the thread at its new location. Just looking at a single ancestor, wouldn't be enough.

Later, use private comments also for direct messages?
    Then can remove: page_users3.joined_by_id,  kicked_by_id  and lots of app server code?

Don't bump page if private comments — or do, for those who can see? Hmm.
      Do send notifications about priv comts to those who can see them & want though.
      Same notf level as for direct messages — instead of the page's notf level?


[cat_mods]
Category moderators.

[see_who_notfd]
When composing a message, see who will get notified — e.g. if mentioning a group,
or editing a message, can be unclar if a newly edit-added @username gets notified or not
(they do get notified).

[filter_mentions] Render usernames that couldn't be mentioned in gray?
[filter_links] Don't link to bad places, e.g. malware site — show such links in plain text
               maybe with a warning? (depends on the community)


[mentions_prio][mentions_prio_c]
Maybe let  0@username generate a link, but no (zero) notification? or ...
       ... [@username]? no that's harder to type?
           =@username could be a looower prio notification, the software won't send any
                      email notf, only show if one visits the forum?
           -@username be a lower prio notification, deliver in a batch per daily
            @username be a low prio notification, deliver every <custom> hours
  no ——>   +@username or ...
  |    ... !@username could be an urgent notification, like, "I'm blocked until answered"
  |       !!@username be a really urgent notification, like, "Server is down"
  |        @@username alternatively?  But '@@' almost looks like just: '@'.
  |               '!@' is more clear?
  |     or 9@username could be high prio? hmm but '!' is maybe more intuitive.
  `\
    `—— Instead, maybe:
        +@username  could subscribe that user to notifications about new comments on that page?
            Some communities relies on mention-to-subscribe quite a lot.
            If it's a private chat, @username gets added to the chat members and can
            thereafter see the chat (& gets notified about new messages).
            But @username only links to hens profile, won't add to the chat.
            And maybe:
        ++@username  could *assign* the page to that user. (Would assign
           the user to the closest ancestor post that is a *task* — in the future,
           also comments can be tasks (mini tasks).)

           Would  --@username  un-assign, then?
           What would  -@username do? Doesn't make sense to unsubscribe sbd else from notfs?


    (skip: ?@username be a question  — maybe it'd be better with marking comments as to-do?
          !?@username be an urgent question )

           @@username (two '@') could be a group notification?
                      E.g. Hi @@support, what [...]?  and probably @@support have
                      configued <custom> (see above) to be quick?
                      Ty would auto add the 2nd '@' even if one typed just 1, if it's a group?


[power_admin]
Various fancy admin features, disabled by default.

[tiny-dialog]
Find (or create?) a tiny modal dialog React class that can be included in slim-bundle.js,
so can open error dialog also if couldn't load more-bundle.js from the server.
Or cache more-bundle.js: PWA and service worker.


[manydrafts]
If there're many drafts for the same thing, show them in a list and let the user choose which
one to continue editing. (Rather than just picking a random one.)


[imp-groups]
Make it possible to impersonate groups. Nice for testing one's access control settings.
Currently disallowed, though, because haven't had time to verify doing things as a group,
wouldn't result in unexpected weird things. And who should be notified about replies to
a test comment made when impersonating a group?
(Everyone in the group? No, they'd get annoyed. Only the group then?)

[group-feats]
Add group visibility settings, e.g. no one (incl members in the group) can see
members in the group — except for some specific groups, e.g. staff.
And who-may-join feautre, and Join/Leave group buttons.
Don't let one self-join groups that grants a trust level higher than one's current level.

[sub_groups]

[cont_settings_t]
Per group and content set settings.
Might need more fine grained settings — per pages-in-category/tag/written-by-authors,
*for* various groups of people. Then,
pats_t, pat_groups_t,  cont(ent)_sets_t and cont_sets_meta_t
and cont_settings_t  can all be useful?  See [cont_settings_t] in db-wip.sql.


[message-managers]
A way to message only the managers in a group, rather than everyone in the group?
Maybe `@managers@group_name` ?

[req-memship]
Add a Request [group] Membership button (for groups that are visible, and that one may
not self-join). Group Managers and Adders then get notified
(Discourse: the 5 most recently active "group owners") — or, if there are none,
then the site staff get notified. Also, if the group managers don't handle the request
within X days, then the site staff get notified? (Passive group managers = not good.)

[lazy-upd-link-origins]
If moves CDN to a different address, or moves Talkyard server to a new address,
then, lazily regenerate html with the correct addresses, for links to uploaded
images etc.

[list_uploaded_files]
Admin page that lists uploaded files, sorts by name or size etc.
Optionally deletes file (initially, maybe just a Linux `rm ...` tips instead).

[sso_plus_oidc]
Let people combine both custom OIDC IDPs with Ty SSO — that's just
fine, some time large organization have more than one authn system,
or they invite external collaborators with other authn systems.

Expired PASETO token in htmlp page — then try fetch from authn server,
once iframe is in view — by asking any ssoRefreshAuthnTokenUrl endpoint.
Maybe rename "AuthnToken"  to "EmbAuthnTkn" ?


[offline-first]
Things to think about, if making Ty work offline.
Use two session ids and cookies — one HttpOnly, another not-HttpOnly. Both needs to be
present, to be logged in. By deleting the not-HttpOnly, one can log out, also if
the server is offline.  And, the HttpOnly session offers a bit extra security.

[serversid]
Server side sesison ids, maybe in Redis? So can log ppl out, without having access
to their browsers to delete session cookies.
(Also see [offline-first] above: need two cookies.)
Include session type (e.g. pwd, oauth, email secret, sso, emb sso) in sid:s,
see: SessionType.AutoTokenSiteCustomSso, and: SidOk(TySession.ApiSecretPart12, ..)
Also see: [weaksid]. [which_ws_session]
Add [sess_deleted_ix]
And [btr_sid].
Missing:  [forget_sid12] [restrict_sid_part_2_more] [bump_sid_last_use]

[sess_in_me]
Store xsrf token and any sid-part-1 in Me, instead of win.typs?

 
[hide_authn_btns]
If auto logged in via token in embedd*ing* html, then, don't show logout button
— instead the embedding site manages login/out for that user, by incl/excl the token.

[weaksid]

SECURITY Use HMAC. Not SHAX. Need not fix urgently. Prevents extension attacks

Generate publicly visible ids that aren't enumerable, e.g. let browser side visible
user ids and post ids, notification ids, etc, be short random strings, or
random 64 bit ints, rather than sequential numbers.
What notf ids and SMTP Message-ID to use instead? [older_notfs_emails]

[emb_login_req]
Make  login-required work also for embeded comments.

[emb_forum]
Make it possible to embedd a forum, or fourm cateory (no just blog comments).

[emb_ifr_shortcuts]
Make shortcuts work also if there're many iframes with blog comments comments
visible at the same time.
[many_ifr_my_page_data]
Make changing notf levels update the UI correctly also if many iframes.

[ty_oemb_og]
Add oEmbed & OpenGraph support to Ty.
See e.g.:

[like-notfs]  [like_vote_notfs]
Done: Send notifications about getting a Like.
Could also:
  Select which notifications get sent over email (e.g. excl Like votes & mod tasks).
  Still visible in username dropdown.



[refactor-notfs]  DONE, except for re-enabling reconnect.
Remove Nchan. Use Rust + server-sent-events instead.  NO, just Play and WebSocket now.

[notf_schedule][snooze_schedule]
Individual prefs:
  Configure when auto-snoozing — e.g. weekends and before & after 0900-1700.
  Get someone's-waiting-for-approval notfs, if that person has been waiting
     for > X hours  *and* no other staff mem has reviewed yet.
  Or optionally if new member joins.

[external-server-js]
What? Same as [ext_markup_processor] ?

[ext_markup_processor]
Convert commonmark to html in external process / server, not in the JVM.
Works ok in the JVM, however, if importing a large site with thousands of posts to
process, that'd almost be a self-DoS. Better delegate to other server.

[rich-text-editor]
Later, support not only CommonMark but also rich text wysiwyg.
Then first need to fix: [DRAFTPRVW] ?

[html_json] [nashorn_in_tx] [save_post_lns_mentions]
Keep sanitized html in a json array with placeholders for site origin,
page titles (internal links), usernames, so the html can be reconstructed
"instantly" if the site origin changes, pages renamed, username changed.
And for different display resolutions — without having to re-render
CommonMark to html (which can be a bit slow).

[nashorn_in_tx]  COULD_OPTIMIZE
Do outside tx.

Use the C preprocessor? Didn't find anything else that does what I'm looking for.

[devfriendly]
Maybe make all endpoints that accept, say, only POST, reply and tell other method

[rebuild_reindex_posts]
A background job that regenerates html (CommonMark –> html) and

Without! any long running db transactions. 1) loads the data it needs, in a read-only tx.

[ty_v1] Things to fix before Ty stack version 1: 0.20YY.NR —> version 1.20YY.NR

Ty v1 is a major release. Server admins will be required to install Ty v1
on a new server, and verify that it works — before shutting down one's Ty v0.
So, it'll be OK to make changes in Ty that otherwise would have been deemed too risky.

Ty v1 removes some deprecated things, e.g.: Remove class ed.server.EdAppLoader (everyone
needs to remove `play.application.loader= ed.server.EdAppLoader` from the Play conf file)

Rename Silhouette authn settings to talkyard.authn.____  instead?
Require that the old conf vals be removed (log helpful errors.)
