Bookmarks are posts, stored in posts3 / nodes_t. Then they'll get doing status fields
"for free" and can later function as one's personal tasks too: planned, doing, done.
  And  due-at  or  remind-at  properties, just like posts might one day have.

At the same time, means we have to avoid accidentally loading bookmarks (>= MinPublicNr tests)
or bookmark authors. [dont_list_bookmarkers]

The parent post is the bookmarked post.

The post nr is <= MaxPrivateNr â€” bookmarks are private: others can't see one's bookmarks.

Bookmarks are shown in the sidebar, so one can single-click jump between different
bookmarked posts, without having to click and open a bookmarks dropdown in between.
(Plus, in a tab on one's profile page.)
