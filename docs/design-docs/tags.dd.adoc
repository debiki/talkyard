== Can tag what?

Each tag type, what things can one tag with it?
There're pages, votes, flags, cats, tags, pats, plugins, nothing (plugin key-value store).
Use a bitfield?

No --------------------
Guests, (built-in users), users, bot users, groups,  = 2^5 - 1 = 31.
  — what about accounts controlled by both a bot and a human? Or if unknown.
Pages (orig posts), replies, meta posts, = 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 - 1 = 32+64+128 = 224
Think about later: categories, tags, votes, flags, edit suggestions, plugins, ... .
------ Intstead?: -----
  Guests = 2^0 + Users = 2^1 + Groups = 2^2       =  7  (instead of 31)
  Pages  = 2^3 + Replies = 2^4 + Meta posts = 2^5 = 56  (instead of 224)

Therefore: domain thing_types_d, can be only 7 or 56, for now.


== Tag values

Idea: Store values in tags_t instead?

either:
tags_t: remove pk
tags_t +=
   has_extra_vals          bool
   extra_val_for_tag_id_c  tag_id_d,

or:
tags_t: add val_nr: 0,1,2,... , 0 could be the main
tags_t +=
   has_extra_vals          bool
   extra_val_for_tag_id_c  tag_id_d,
   val_type_c     val_type_d,   -- e.g. date —> val_i64_c = unix time millis?
                                -- date_range —> val_i64_end_c  = end date range?
                                -- CVE score: (0, 10]
                                -- SemVer2 —> regex check?
                                -- etc etc

and/or just inline all values, maybe:
(Foreign keys won't work, but the simplicity and the higher performance and the
lower bug risk (than if joining with a tag values table) is worth it I think!
See: http://www.databasesoup.com/2015/01/tag-all-things.html & part 2 & 3.)

    val_i64_c      i64_d,
    val_i64_end_c  i64_d,
    val_f64_c      f64_d,
    val_f64_end_c  f64_d,

    val_title_c    text w max len,
    val_http_url_c http_url_d,

    val_i32_arr_c   i32[],
    val_i64_arr_c   i64[],
    val_f64_arr_c   f64[],
    val_text_arr_c  text[],

    val_jsonb_c    jsonb_max_NNN_bytes,

And tag_types_t:
  allowed_val_types_c  User   for example    — maybe a bitfield?
  max_num_vals_c      5   (0..=100 for example)   — e.g. assign sth to 5 ppl?


Mat views are reealy slow, often out of sync:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29437650/how-can-i-ensure-that-a-materialized-view-is-always-up-to-date

Later:

In Talkyard, tags will be able to have values. E.g. an Assigned-To page tag,
with its value being the person (or people, or group) responsible for gettin it done.

Or a Do-After tag, saying that something should/needs-to wait until
after another feature/problem has been done/fixed.

Or a "Staff Notes" tag (user badge) on a person, visible only to staff,
which links to a staff-only page with notes and comments about that person.

(Or could it be better to have these in dedicated tables?)

Probably there'd be some default tag types, in the same way as there are
default categories (ideas, questions etc).
They could be: Assigned-To and Staff-Notes?

There could be numeric or text values, e.g. `version: `1.23.01-beta-1`,
or `price: 234` (but what currency?).  Or `location-lat: 123` `..-long: 456`?
Or `Happens-In-City: (some city)`, or `Happens-At: (date-time)`

This could also be achieved via a consistent tag naming scheme,
like people do in GitHub, e.g.: `version-1.23.01-beta-1`
or `happens-in-London` and `happens-in-Barcelona`,
but then it's cumbersome or even infeasible to change `happens-in-` to, say,
`Happens in: ` or `Where: ` or `location-`
— instead of just renaming one tag (the "Happens in city" tag),
you'd have to rename _all_ tags with that prefix.

What values would be nice to support?

CVE numbers: float (0.0, 10.0].
Software versions: string?
Pat list.
Page list.
Date-time.
Date-time range.
Many date-time ranges? (a many evenings / days event)
Cat list?
Tag list? Hmm

== How tags are shown

Only if needed / many people ask for this.

Can be nice to abbreviate long tag names or values. Therefore:
`show_tag_how_d`. For now, just don't-show = 0, or show full name and value = 16.
In the distant future:

----
create domain show_tag_how_d  i16
    bits 0, 1:   0 = don't show name, 1 = show very abbreviated,
                 2 = show bit abbreviated, 3 = show full (default)
    bits 2, 3:   same, for any tag value
    bits 4 - 6:  if many values, 0 = don't show,
                 1 = just show num values (click to expand),
                 2 = show 1 value, 3 = show 3, 4 = show 7,
                 5 = show 14, 6 = show 30, 7 = show all?
    bits 7 - x:  ?show votes on tag how?  0 = don't show votes
----

Initially, only full names and maybe abbreviated names.

Or maybe, instead of bitfield (but this won't work with very-abbreviated tag names)

----
create domain show_tag_how_d  i16_gez_d & <= 9:
    0: don't-show here,
    1: tag name abbr,
    2: tag name full,

    3: tag value abbr,
    4: tag value full,

    5: abbr-name: abbr value(s)
    6: abbr-name: value
    6: name: abbr value(s)
    7: full name, value
    8: full name, expanded value: <= 4 rows
    9: full name, expanded value: <= 12 rows
----

If many values, then, better placed after the post? rather than in the header.


=== Maybe much later

.

==== Vote on tags?

Inspired by Gerrit, maybe Do-It votes on tags?

-- create domain may_do_it_vote_d i16_d,
--     lower 8 bits is max negative vote (e.g. -2 to block),
--     upper 8 bits is max positive number (e.g. +1 looks-good-to-me)
or just:
    tags_t
        max_do_it_vote_c  i16_gez_d,
        max_do_not_vote_c i16_gez_d,
