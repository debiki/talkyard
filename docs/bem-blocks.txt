BEM = Block-Element-Modifier (web-search it, if you don't know what it is).

These short names are (for me at least) more readable than long not-abbreviated names.
You just need to get used to the abbreviations :-) And not forget them. Hence this file.

s_ = some_Whatever (for classes)
t_ = the_Whatever (for ids)
e_ = end-to-end-test_Whatever (classes only, for stuff to click in End-to-End tests)
p_ = public api (classes only, not ids)

Big CSS refactoring: s_  —>  c_  for class attr — then, easy to know what's been refactored.
And  t_  —>  i_  for 'id' attr
And  e_  —>  t_  for tests

s_w-X = wraps an X, i.e., somewhere inside, there's an X. Or "'W'ith a X inside".
w_X   = wraps X. Always a class, not an id.
