Making *.localhost addresses work
=============================

Chrome seems to handle `*.localhost` addresses in a good way, i.e. it sends the HTTP request
to 127.0.0.1. However, for other browsers, and for test suites that send API requests
outside the browser, you need to make `*.localhost` addresses work (resolve to localhost).

Why? Because the tests generates website addresses like: `e2e-test-site-random_id.localhost`.

It'd been great if we could just have added a `127.0.0.1  *.localhost` entry to `/etc/hosts`,
But wildcard `/etc/hosts` entries are not allowed. Instead, we can ...


Linux
-----------------------------


Use dnsmasq (see http://serverfault.com/a/118589/44112 ).

#### Linux Mint and Ubuntu

NetworkManager already runs its own instance of
dnsmasq. You can make `*.localhost` work like so: (do this only once)

    sudo sh -c 'echo "address=/localhost/127.0.0.1" >> /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/wildcard.localhost.conf'

Then restart NetworkManager:

    sudo service network-manager restart

    # Hmm seems now it's instead: (Debian 11)
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

Wait half a minute, then this should work: `ping whatever.localhost`.

#### Debian

Like Ubuntu, plus, you need this, to tell NetworkManager to use dnsmasq:

    $ cat /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-use-dnsmasq.conf

    # Start a local dnsmasq DNS server that we can configure to resolve *.localhost.
    # On Ubuntu, Netw-Mgr uses dnsmasq by default, but on Debian, we need this:
    [main]
    dns=dnsmasq

#### Qubes OS Standalone VM

Assuming you use a stand-alone Debian qube (i.e. VM) for developing
Talkyard, then, **follow the instructions** for **Debian** (!) just above.

Hmm, but edit: `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`, which already exists,
instead of `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-use-dnsmasq.conf`.

And, you also need to tell Qubes OS to actually start NetworkManager
in the qube â€” starting it from
inside the qube itself won't work. In dom0, do this:

    qvm-service --enable YOUR_DEBIAN_QUBE_NAME network-manager

And apparently you need to reboot the qube too.

#### Qubes OS AppVM

You need to run the `sudo sh -c 'echo ...'` command above in the template VM
(not the AppVM) so the changes in `/etc/` won't disappear on restart.


Mac
-----------------------------

Use dnsmasq (see http://serverfault.com/a/118589/44112 ).

I don't have a Mac, but this supposedly works:

    sudo port install dnsmasq

    vi /opt/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf # edit it, ...
    # ... add the following line: (without the #)
    # address=/localhost.com/127.0.0.1

    # then:
    sudo port load dnsmasq


Windows
-----------------------------

I don't know. Ideas welcome
