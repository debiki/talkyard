All End-to-End tests and where to find them
============================================

E2e tests take long to run. Therefore, to save time, a single e2e test sometimes tests
many things. But then it's hard to give it a name that describes everything it does. Instead
here you'll find a map of all things that are e2e tested, and in which files. A single file
might be listed at many places in the tree, if it tests different things.

(ABC123) means see-elsewhere-in-this-file = search for ABC123 in this file.
[ABC123] = search all files everywhere

Run all tests in different resolutions? Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile.

I'm planning to implement the text on lines with "NEXT" soon (probably because
someone reproted a bug & it got fixed, better avoid regressions.)

  works after many long-polls:

  works after disconnection: |   [5YVBAR2]
    There's: browser.setNetworkConnection(); see http://webdriver.io/api/mobile/setNetworkConnection.html
    and ChromeDriver set_network_conditions, seems more flexible: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46672769/694469
    And can patch: var orig = xhr.method; xhr.method = function(){ ... else return orig.apply(this, arguments); };
       — just call onerror in the patch?
