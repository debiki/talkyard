It's table descriptions and custom domains, generated by:  'psql \d table_name'.
This script:

```
for table_name in $(docker-compose exec -T rdb psql -c '\d' talkyard talkyard \
   | grep ' table '   \
   | awk '{ print $3 }')
do
    docker-compose exec -T rdb psql talkyard talkyard -c '\d '"$table_name" \
          | tee ./docs/db-schema/$table_name.txt
done

# Custom domains, with and without comments:
docker-compose exec -T rdb psql talkyard talkyard -c '\dD+' \
          | tee ./docs/db-schema/domains.txt
docker-compose exec -T rdb psql talkyard talkyard -c '\dD' \
          | tee ./docs/db-schema/domains-no-comments.txt
```

Details:  \d lists all tables and sequences, this format:

talkyard=> \d 
                   List of relations
 Schema |          Name           |   Type   |  Owner   
--------+-------------------------+----------+----------
 public | alt_page_ids3           | table    | talkyard
 public | api_secrets3            | table    | talkyard
 public | audit_log3              | table    | talkyard
 ...
 public | dw1_tenants_id          | sequence | talkyard
 public | emails_out3             | table    | talkyard
 ...


The table name is in column 3  (the pipe '|' being column $2),
and, `grep` because we want tables only (not sequences).
