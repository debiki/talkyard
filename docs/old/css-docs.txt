I've used rather short CSS class names. Perhaps that was a weird idea. Anyway,
this file lists those terribly short class names, and their meanings.


Listing all CSS classes
---------------------

Like so: (old `find`, finds nothing nowadays?)
 find debiki-core-basedir/src -type f -print0 | \
   xargs -0 egrep -ho "dw-[[:alnum:]-]+" | sort | uniq -c

Narrower:
 find src/main/scala/com/debiki/v0/html.scala src/main/scala/com/debiki/v0/App.scala src/main/resources/js/debiki.js src/main/resources/css/debiki.css ../../debiki-jspwiki-forum/src/main -type f -print0 | xargs -0 egrep -ho "dw-[[:alnum:]-]+" | sort | uniq -c

/* Public CSS API  -- DEPRECATED  I think e.g. simply .lt-ie7 is better /edit: Now I don't support IE7 anyway. */

Sometimes including a version number (i.e. '0'), if the behavior
might change in the future.

.debiki-show-if-lte-ie7
.debiki-show-if-lte-ie8
.debiki-show-unless-lte-ie7
.debiki-show-unless-lte-ie8

.esActiveHeaderLink
  Added to the longest link in the header html that matches the current URL
  (matches = the current URL starts with the link, longes = the longest a.href)
  You could style it, so people knows where they are, e.g. like so:
    .esActiveHeaderLink {
      font-weight: bold;
      font-size: 105%;
    }
