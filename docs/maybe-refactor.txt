Rename all old Scala packages from  ed.server.* and com.debiki.*
to  talkyard.server.*


[page_members_t]
Anyone who has added an open chat to hens watchbar, or subscribed to
notfs about that chat (page_notf_prefs_t),
*and* can see the chat topic (the category it is in),
is a member of that open chat.

But don't normally use  page_users3.joined_by_id  for that.

Instead, break out joined_by_id to a new table:  page_members_t ?
and use only for private chat channels and direct messages?

(And, some time later, to optionally add specific users to chats
they otherwise would be unable to access. Expire access after X days
by default, or at a date-time, or if they leave the community
or category access permissions change (less access) or trust level demoted.)

[flags_as_posts]
Move flags from post_actions_t to posts_t instead, with PostType.Flag.
