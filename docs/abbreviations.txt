Abbreviations. Makes it 1) take longer to get up to speed with contributing
to Talkyard (Ty), and 2) make you faster, and less bored, once you've gotten used
to the abbreviations (if ever).  It's a tradeoff :- )


Git branches

New Git branch names should have these prefixes: (this is Gitflow inspired)

- p/<name>/*  = Someone's personal work-in-progress branches.
                Note: History might get rewritten at any time (!). The <name> can be just
                a letter, for example, KajMagnus (who started this project) is 'm' for
                Magnus. So, p/m/a and p/m/b are Magnus' personal 'a' and 'b' branches.
                (What about 'p/' as in Private branches? They would be in another repo,
                a private repo, instead.)
- t/*         = Topic branches. They're shared between contributors (not personal).
                This includes new features, bug fixes, refactorings. (It's nice
                to just call all these things "topic" branches, so there's no need to
                spend time discussing more precisely what something is?)
                (These can sometimes be merged into main, before they're finished
                and work is still ongoing, with new functionality hidden behind feature
                flags — for more continuous continuous integration.)
- x/*         = Experimental branch. Something we're trying out and only maybe will merge.
                Probably you'll know, when starting something, if it's experimental,
                or if it's intended to get merged into main?
- o/*         = Historical (old) branch. An experimental or topic branch that didn't
                work out well, wasn't merged. Maybe it was a good idea, but for some
                reason not possible (e.g. Ghost single sign on, we tried, but it won't
                work currently, because Ghost's API does not yet support it). The code
                might still be useful, for another attempt later, so, we kept the branch.
- main        = The main branch, into which new features and fixes get added.
                Others sometimes call this the "development" branch.
                Should always be in a build & runnable state.
- main-ci     = Topic branches get meregd into main-ci, and trigger a CI build. If the
                build and auto tests work fine, the main branch is fast-forwarded
                to main-ci. Thereafter, main-ci and main are the same,
                until it's time to merge a new topic branch — then, again, main-ci will
                be one step ahead of main, for a short while (until CI build succeeded).
- release     = The last released version, production ready (might not incl hotfixes though).
- r/*         = Release branches, e.g. for Q/A testing & stabilizing a release before
                it's released, and for patching it after it got released.
                Created only if needed. This far (April 2022) there are none.
- h/*         = Hotfixes for release (r/*) branches.
- d/*         = Branch should get deleted (incl any other branches at the same revision).
                Maybe hen who pushed wanted to double check sth first, and pushed d/<sth>
                just to remember to delete the branch later.
- u/*         = Unknown. Something that doesn't fit the above. What's that? I don't know.



CSS, BEM blocks

BEM = Block-Element-Modifier (web-search it, if you don't know what it is).

These short names are (for me at least) more readable than long not-abbreviated names.
You just need to get used to the abbreviations :-) And not forget them. Hence this file.

s_ = some_Whatever (for classes) NO. Intstead:
c_ = class
t_ = the_Whatever (for ids)  NO (because looks like "test"), instead:
i_ = id
n_ = a class with No styles unless there's another selector before.
     They're widget layout helpers, e.g. n_Row1 or n_Col1, 2, 3.
     This is ok:
        .c_Widget .n_Row1 { ... styles ... }   // other selector before
     but this is not :
        .n_Row1 { ... styles ... }
        .n_Row1 .c_Something { ... styles ... }
     Should *not* be included in Ty's BEM block names.
     So, *not*:  c_Widget_Row2_Part
     instead: c_Widegt .n_Row2 .c_Widegt_Part
     But why? Because otherwise the BEM block names can get annoyingly long.
     It's nice to have a *safe* way to arrange the parts of a widget in rows and columns,
     without then having to rename all parts of the widget — just adding, say,
     n_Row1 and n_Row2, and editing the .c_Sth .n_Row1/2 CSS, but nothing else
     (not having to rename c_Sth_...Sub... to c_Sth_Row1_...Sub... everywhere).
e_ = end-to-end-test_Whatever (classes only, for widgets to click in End-to-End tests)
p_ = public api (classes only, not ids)

Big CSS refactoring: s_  —>  c_  for class attr — then, easy to know what's been refactored.
And  t_  —>  i_  for 'id' attr.

s_w-X = wraps an X, i.e., somewhere inside, there's an X. Or "'W'ith a X inside".
w_X   = wraps X. Always a class, not an id.
